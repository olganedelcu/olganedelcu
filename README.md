## Hey there, I'm Olga ☺️

I love technology, so I became a software engineer and built my career in Germany (fintech and industrial sectors).

I'm a software engineer with 4+ years of production experience across fintech and industrial sectors, specializing in modern frontend architectures and scalable web applications.

Tech stack: React, TypeScript, JavaScript, modern testing frameworks, and full-stack web development.
