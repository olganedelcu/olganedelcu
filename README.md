## Hey there, I'm Olga ☺️

I love technology, so I became a software engineer and built my career in Germany (fintech and industrial sectors).

But honestly? I know what it's like to feel stuck in a role that doesn't fit.

That's why my two sisters and I started Jobsties - international professionals deserve way better.

We've now helped 150+ people land jobs at Brita, Siemens, Impress, eBay and more 🚀

🌱 Leading Jobsties now - coaching, tools, and community for job seekers across Europe. I build products and share what actually works.
