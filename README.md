# Hey!👋🏼I'm Olga
I'm a software fanatic specialized in the modern JavaScript stack with sperience in the latest web technologies including React.js, Node, GraphQL and Typescript(in the making😉). Driven by continious improvement looking to contribute to the AMAZING software COMMUNITY. 

Motivated by curiosity I decided at a young age to pursue a carrer in the software industry. 

At the moment I am developing my skills in JS, React and Typescript also the tedious testing part working with Cypress. 

In my free time, I like to run and watch: JS.

Have yourself a LOVELY DAY :)
