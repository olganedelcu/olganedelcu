## Hey there, I'm Olga ☺️

I know what it’s like to feel stuck in a role that doesn’t truly fit. Together with my two sisters, I co‑founded **Jobsties**, because we believe international professionals deserve better.

Growing up loving technology led me to pursue software engineering. And that enabled me to build a career in Germany, working for fintech and industrial sectors. 

Now, through Jobsties, we’ve empowered over 100+ professionals to build global careers at Brita, Siemens, Impress, eBay and many more 🚀

🌱 Currently leading Jobsties - a career platform offering coaching, application tools, and community resources. I build products and share insights to help job seekers succeed across Europe.
